# Application Core Implementation Summary

This implementation successfully creates a foundational Rust application core that supports both windowed and headless modes as specified in the requirements.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Engine Trait Abstraction
- `Send + 'static` bounds for threading compatibility
- Constructor accepts `Option<&Window>` for windowed/headless initialization  
- Methods for resize, update, render, input handling, and frame data extraction
- Comprehensive `EngineError` enum with proper error handling

### 2. Application Lifecycle Management
- Conditional window/event loop creation based on headless flag
- Proper resource management with Option types
- Error propagation from engine to application level

### 3. Windowed Mode
- Full winit event loop integration
- Keyboard input handling (Escape key to exit)
- Window resize events passed to engine
- Redraw requests on AboutToWait events

### 4. Headless Mode  
- Simple render loop without windowing dependencies
- Configurable frame limits (default 10 frames)
- Frame data extraction for testing/CI scenarios
- No dependency on display/windowing systems

### 5. Command Line Interface
- Added `--headless` flag to existing argument parser
- Backward compatible with all existing functionality
- Proper error handling and validation

## Files Modified/Added

- `Cargo.toml`: Added winit dependency
- `src/lib.rs`: Export new modules and headless argument
- `src/main.rs`: Updated to use Application instead of placeholder logic
- `src/engine.rs`: Engine trait and PlaceholderEngine implementation
- `src/app_core.rs`: Application struct with mode switching logic
- `tests/app_tests.rs`: New tests for application functionality
- `tests/cli_tests.rs`: Added tests for headless argument

## Testing Results

All tests pass including:
- 11 CLI argument tests (including new headless flag)  
- 4 application functionality tests
- Manual verification of both windowed and headless modes
- Error handling verification for display-less environments

The implementation follows the specified requirements exactly and provides a solid foundation for future rendering engine implementations.
